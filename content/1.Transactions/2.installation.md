title: Git Branches, Commits, and Merging
description: A focused guide on naming branches, writing meaningful commits, and merging efficiently to streamline collaboration and development workflows.
---

This document provides guidance on best practices for naming branches, structuring commit messages, and merging branches in Git to maintain a clean and efficient workflow.

## Naming Branches

### Guidelines for Branch Names

- **Use clear prefixes** to indicate the purpose of the branch:* `feature/<name>` for new features.
  * `bugfix/<name>` for bug fixes.
  * `hotfix/<name>` for urgent production fixes.
  * `release/<version>` for release preparation.
- **Include a short and descriptive task name:*** Example: `feature/login-ui`, `bugfix/user-auth`.
- **Include task IDs if applicable:*** Example: `feature/123-add-user-profile`.
- **Avoid special characters** (use hyphens for separation).

### Examples of Good Branch Names

- `feature/add-dashboard`
- `bugfix/fix-login-error`
- `hotfix/urgent-patch`
- `release/1.0.0`

## Writing Commit Messages

### Commit Message Structure

1. **Title (mandatory):**

- A concise summary of the change (50 characters max).
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature," "Fix login bug").

```text
Add user authentication feature

```

2. **Body (optional):**

- A detailed explanation of what and why.
- Wrap lines at 72 characters.

```text
- Implemented user login/logout functionality.
- Added session persistence for improved UX.
- Fixed related bugs in the authentication service.

```

3. **Footer (optional):**

- Reference relevant issue or task IDs.

```text
Closes #123

```

### Best Practices for Commits

- **Keep commits small and focused:** Each commit should represent one logical change.
- **Avoid generic messages:** Avoid titles like "Fix stuff" or "Update."
- **Group related changes:** If multiple files are modified for the same purpose, include them in one commit.
- **Use atomic commits:** Each commit should result in a working state.

## Merging Branches

### Workflow for Merging

1. **Update your branch:**```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Test locally:** Ensure your branch works as expected.
3. **Open a pull request (PR):**

- Clearly describe the purpose and changes.
- Ensure the branch is up-to-date with the target branch.

4. **Code review:** Collaborate with your team to review the changes.
5. **Merge the PR:**

- Use "squash and merge" to keep a clean history.
- Example:```bash
  git merge --squash feature/new-feature
  ```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. Identify conflicting files:```bash
   git status
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts manually by editing files.
3. Stage resolved files:```bash
   git add <file-name>
   ```
4. Complete the merge:```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Best Practices for Merging

- **Keep the main branch protected:** Avoid direct commits to `main`.
- **Use PR templates:** Standardize PR descriptions for consistency.
- **Test after merging:** Ensure no issues were introduced.

## Collaboration Tips

### Keeping a Clean Repository

- Regularly delete merged branches:```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```
- Delete remote branches after merging:```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```

### Communication

- Use clear and descriptive commit messages to facilitate collaboration.
- Regularly update your team about the status of your branch and PR.
