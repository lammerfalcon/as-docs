title: Git Branches, Commits, and Merging
description: A focused guide on naming branches, writing meaningful commits, and merging efficiently to streamline collaboration and development workflows.

This document provides guidance on best practices for naming branches, structuring commit messages, and merging branches in Git to maintain a clean and efficient workflow.

## Naming Branches

### Guidelines for Branch Names
- **Use clear prefixes** to indicate the purpose of the branch:
  - `feature/<name>` for new features.
  - `bugfix/<name>` for bug fixes.
  - `hotfix/<name>` for urgent production fixes.
  - `release/<version>` for release preparation.
- **Include a short and descriptive task name:**
  - Example: `feature/login-ui`, `bugfix/user-auth`.
- **Include task IDs if applicable:**
  - Example: `feature/123-add-user-profile`.
- **Avoid special characters** (use hyphens for separation).

### Examples of Good Branch Names
- `feature/add-dashboard`
- `bugfix/fix-login-error`
- `hotfix/urgent-patch`
- `release/1.0.0`

## Writing Commit Messages

### Commit Message Structure
1. **Title (mandatory):**
  - A concise summary of the change (50 characters max).
  - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add new feature," "Fix login bug").
   ```
   Add user authentication feature
   ```

2. **Body (optional):**
  - A detailed explanation of what and why.
  - Wrap lines at 72 characters.
   ```
   - Implemented user login/logout functionality.
   - Added session persistence for improved UX.
   - Fixed related bugs in the authentication service.
   ```

3. **Footer (optional):**
  - Reference relevant issue or task IDs.
   ```
   Closes #123
   ```

### Best Practices for Commits
- **Keep commits small and focused:** Each commit should represent one logical change.
- **Avoid generic messages:** Avoid titles like "Fix stuff" or "Update."
- **Group related changes:** If multiple files are modified for the same purpose, include them in one commit.
- **Use atomic commits:** Each commit should result in a working state.

## Merging Branches

### Workflow for Merging
1. **Update your branch:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
2. **Test locally:** Ensure your branch works as expected.
3. **Open a pull request (PR):**
  - Clearly describe the purpose and changes.
  - Ensure the branch is up-to-date with the target branch.
4. **Code review:** Collaborate with your team to review the changes.
5. **Merge the PR:**
  - Use "squash and merge" to keep a clean history.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    git merge --squash feature/new-feature
    ```

### Resolving Merge Conflicts
1. Identify conflicting files:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
2. Resolve conflicts manually by editing files.
3. Stage resolved files:
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   ```
4. Complete the merge:
   ```bash
   git commit
   ```

### Best Practices for Merging
- **Keep the main branch protected:** Avoid direct commits to `main`.
- **Use PR templates:** Standardize PR descriptions for consistency.
- **Test after merging:** Ensure no issues were introduced.

## Collaboration Tips

### Keeping a Clean Repository
- Regularly delete merged branches:
  ```bash
  git branch -d <branch-name>
  ```
- Delete remote branches after merging:
  ```bash
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>
  ```

### Communication
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages to facilitate collaboration.
- Regularly update your team about the status of your branch and PR.
