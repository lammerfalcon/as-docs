## Business Questions

### Currency and Platform Transfers
1. Can transfers between accounts with different currencies be allowed? If yes, should currency conversion apply?
2. Can transfers occur across different platforms? What are the constraints if currencies differ?

### Fee Application
- **Balance to Account:** Fee is deducted from the target account.
- **Account to Account:** Fee application options include:
  - Source account only
  - Target account only
  - Both source and target accounts
  - Minimum of source and target account fees
  - Maximum of source and target account fees
  - Should this operation be restricted?
- **Account to Balance:** Fee is deducted from the source account (or no fee applied).

### Account Balance Display
- Balance visibility is required. A design is needed for presenting account balances in the UI.

### Account Top-Up Workflow
- Define logic for auto-filling transfer forms when initiating a top-up action from an account.
